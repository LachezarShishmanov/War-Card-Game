## How to play war
War uses standard 52-card deck. Deal cards back and forth so that each player has 26 cards. Do not look at your cards.
To play, count down from 3 and flip cards at the same time so that they are face up. Only flip the top card, no peaking! Other cards must remain secret. The player with the higher card wins and collects both cards, returning the cards to the bottom of their personal deck. If players flip the same value cards  then it is a tie and neither player wins. They return the cards to the bottom of their personal deck. The player who has more cards at the end wins the game.
