Number of cards: Standard 52 cards

The deal: Each player receives 26 cards - dealing one at a time. Each player places his stack of cards face down, in front of him.

## How to play war
War uses standard 52-card deck. Deal cards back and forth so that each player has 26 cards. Do not look at your cards.
To play, count down from 3 and flip cards at the same time so that they are face up. Only flip the top card, no peaking! Other cards must remain secret. The player with the higher card wins and collects both cards, returning the cards to the bottom of their personal deck. If players flip the same card, the war begins.
THE WAR
During a war, each player places three more cards, face down on the table and after flip over a fourth so that it is face up. Whoever's card is the highest is the winner. They collect all the cards 10 in total and the next round begins. If the fourth cards are also the same, repeat the previous instructions until there is a winner.
If a player does not have enough cards for the war they must place their last card face up.
